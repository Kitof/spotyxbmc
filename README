TINKER AROUND (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------------
No need for a advancedsettings, spotify is now enabled by default!

Create advancedsettings.xml in ~/.xbmc/userdata/
Possible settings for the advancedsettings.xml is in full:

<advancedsettings>
	<spotify>
		<enable>true</enable>
		<username>USERNAME</username>
		<password>SECRETPASSWORD</password>
		<cachefolder>/home/YOURUSER/cache/spotify/</cachefolder>
		<maxsearchartists>30</maxsearchartists>
		<maxsearchalbums>30</maxsearchalbums>
		<maxsearchtracks>150</maxsearchtracks>
	</spotify>
</advancedsettings>

Run XBMC the usual way, and hopefully everything works as expected.
NOTE that you have to activate library mode to be able to access the Spotify content.

CHANGELOG
--------------------------------

alpha010
***********************
- Moved to openspotify due to license stuff
- Moved almost all menu logic to the spotifyDirectory, some things are not working at all yet
- Fixed tracks rating
- The ability to determine if an album or track is available in your country is currently not implemented, therefor you will get a lot of albums that are not playable when you search and browse
- A lot of new problems, I know
- Crashes and slowdowns 
- We have switched to libopenspotify but you can however still use libspotify if you dare. Just download it, install it and set the lib dependencies to libspotify!
